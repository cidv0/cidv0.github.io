      <h1>Arc Raiders &mdash; Events, Secret Rooms &amp; Loot Puzzles Guide</h1>
      <p class="note">
        A long-form breakdown of dynamic events, map conditions, secret puzzles, and key loot rooms so you can maximize your haul in <strong>Arc Raiders</strong>.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section id="intro">
      <p>
        Fellas, the amount of secret events, rooms, loot puzzles that exist inside of Arc Raiders is staggering, and it is completely understandable if most of you do not even know what they are or what they do or how to complete them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is why today we are going to walk through each of these events. We will go over several in-game puzzles as well as key loot rooms so that you can earn the most loot possible. And believe me, this is going to net you fantastic drops, everything from epics to even potential legendaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        But first, let us talk <strong>dynamic events</strong>.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="dynamic-events">
      <h2>Dynamic Events Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Inside of Arc Raiders, there are dynamic map events that alter your experience topside for a limited amount of time. Each event lasts for <strong>1 hour</strong>, and they cycle between maps throughout the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you go to select a map, you can tell an event is active if a little icon is present right next to the map name. Clicking on the map will give you some basic information, but it does not truly explain what to do during these events, hence this guide.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="launch-tower-loots">
      <h2>Launch Tower Loots (Assera Spaceport)</h2>
      <p>
        Launch tower loots may be one of the most confusing events in the game, but it is also one of the most rewarding events on <strong>Assera Spaceport</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a giant launch tower in the center of the map and it is hard to miss. Normally, you could take the zip lines to the top, clear a few Pops and Fireballs, and snag some okay loot.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this event, the zip lines are <strong>blocked</strong>. The only way to access them is to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find a <strong>fuel cell</strong></li>
        <li>Carry it to one of the generators on either side of the town</li>
        <li>Take it up to the launch pad beneath the tower</li>
        <li>Deposit the fuel cell and pull the lever</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pulling the lever opens the doors leading to the zip lines.
      </p>

      <h3>Clearing the Top and Dealing with the Rocketeer</h3>
      <p>
        Once you are up top, clear the room of Arc units. Put down <strong>jolt mines</strong> or <strong>explosive mines</strong> in front of the zip lines because plenty of players will try to sneak you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, take out the <strong>Rocketeer</strong>. If you have a <strong>Pharaoh</strong>, peek, shoot his front thrusters, and if he fires back, duck inside. Repeat until he is down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then take the stairs to the top of the tower. From there, jump across the gap to access the other side of the tower and clear that room too.
      </p>

      <h3>Starting the Event and Looting</h3>
      <p>
        At the top of the tower, two panels sit on each side of the gap. Activating both starts an alarm and spawns a wave of <strong>Hornets</strong> and <strong>Wasps</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Retreat inside and pick off the drones from cover until they are gone. When you return to the top, <strong>two crates</strong> appear near the buttons you hit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The loot is excellent: weapons like <strong>Volcano</strong>, <strong>Bobcat</strong>, <strong>Tempest</strong>, and more.
      </p>
      <p>
        After you loot, head back to the zip lines you used earlier. Keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The fuel cell only opens the doors on <strong>one side</strong></li>
        <li>You can only exit the way you came</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Do <strong>not</strong> try to jump the gap while encumbered. If you need everything, drop items, jump across, then go back.
      </p>
      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Warning:</strong> This is one of the harder events. Expect heavy PvP and PvE. A Rocketeer guards the launchpad and raiders will camp to steal your loot.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="uncovered-caches">
      <h2>Uncovered Caches</h2>
      <p>
        This event has its own icon. During <strong>Uncovered Caches</strong>, raider caches are revealed briefly before they <strong>explode</strong>. Loot them quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Raider caches are marked with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A small red sign</li>
        <li>A white arrow</li>
        <li>A quiet ticking noise when you approach</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Raider caches usually contain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Ammo</li>
        <li>Bandages</li>
        <li>Shields</li>
        <li>Other basic supplies and XP</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <strong>interactive map</strong> (community sourced) is the best way to find cache spawn locations and plenty of other intel.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="prospecting-probes">
      <h2>Prospecting Probes</h2>
      <p>
        During a match, you may notice rockets taking off and landing randomly. These are <strong>Arc probes</strong> loaded with Arc materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the <strong>Prospecting Probes</strong> event (look for the icon), tons of Arc probes spawn. Some are damaged; others are active.
      </p>
      <p>
        Active probes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Stand upright</li>
        <li>Emit a repeating ping</li>
        <li>Make a ton of noise while you breach them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rewards are worth it: these are great sources of <strong>Arc circuitry</strong> and <strong>motion cores</strong>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Circuitry</strong> &mdash; Used to craft medium shields and power rods</li>
        <li><strong>Motion cores</strong> &mdash; Used to upgrade your refiner to level 2 and craft items like the magnetic accelerator (which builds the Equalizer and Jupiter)</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="callout">
        If there is a resource you need, watch the event rotation. Prospecting Probes massively increases key material drops.
      </div>
    </section>

    <section id="harvester-events">
      <h2>Harvester Events and the Queen</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Harvester</strong> event is one of the pinnacle encounters. You have probably seen the Arc ship guarded by the <strong>Queen</strong>, the most difficult Arc in the game.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have three options when entering:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Option 1:</strong> Skip it.</li>
        <li><strong>Option 2:</strong> Group up and fight the Queen for a <strong>reactor</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Option 3:</strong> Sneak past the Queen and complete the <strong>Harvester puzzle</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Approaching the Harvester</h3>
      <p>
        For the puzzle route, approach from <strong>behind</strong> the Queen while she circles the craft.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Harvester periodically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fires rockets</li>
        <li>Spits fire out of its three entrances roughly every 45 seconds</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Priority one: <strong>do not be inside</strong> when this happens. An alarm sounds, the room turns yellow, and the exits open before the flames.
      </p>

      <h3>Finding and Placing the Canisters</h3>
      <p>
        Breach one of the entrances to reach the interior. Inside you will find:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One black canister on the ground</li>
        <li>Two more hidden around the structure</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ride the elevators, breach wall panels, and search. If a breach says <em>"Search, keep looking"</em>, keep going until you find the canisters. Drop each to the first floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeat while dodging flames until all <strong>three black canisters</strong> are on the bottom level.
      </p>

      <h3>Activating the Core</h3>
      <p>
        Interact with the Harvester core at <strong>three different spots</strong>. This exposes three receptacles where you deposit the canisters, starting the next phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yellow protrusions pop from the walls. Now:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Damage and destroy all yellow protrusions</li>
        <li>Use high DPS weapons</li>
        <li>Shoot the top ones and melee the lower ones</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tip: Jump and melee for vertical swings; they connect more than the default horizontal slash.
      </p>

      <h3>Electrical Pulse and Fire Cleanses</h3>
      <p>
        The Harvester uses an <strong>electrical pulse</strong> that can zero shields fast. Consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Removing your shields</li>
        <li>Or bringing an extra shield</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are too slow, the Harvester cleanses the room with fire, the protrusions disappear, and you must reinsert the canisters and repeat.
      </p>

      <h3>Rewards</h3>
      <p>
        Once every protrusion is destroyed, the puzzle ends. <strong>Three caches</strong> appear from the core and should contain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One <strong>Equalizer</strong> blueprint</li>
        <li>One <strong>Jupiter</strong> blueprint</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Put these in your <strong>safe slot</strong> to keep them even if you die.
      </p>
      <p>
        Loot the rest of the Harvester for more Arc components and <strong>energy ammo</strong>, which legendary weapons consume.
      </p>

      <div class="callout">
        <strong>Leaving Safely:</strong>
        The Rocketeer can spot you easily. Consider killing it before leaving. Other players love to camp nearby rocks and pick you off. Smokes are invaluable for a safe exit.
      </div>

      <p>
        Back at base, consume the legendary blueprints to learn the recipes. You need a <strong>level 3 gunsmith</strong> to craft them later.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="husk-graveyard">
      <h2>Husk Graveyard</h2>
      <p>
        Husk Graveyard, marked with its own icon, is one of the most profitable events.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the event:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More Husks spawn across the map</li>
        <li>Many are <strong>electrified</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Electrified Husks stun you when you open them. Dodge right before breaching, then search.
      </p>
      <p>
        Normally you might get damaged components, but during Husk Graveyard there is a much higher chance (if not guaranteed) that items are <strong>not damaged</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find drivers for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Wasp</li>
        <li>Hornets</li>
        <li>Rocketeers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Target Rocketeers on Dam Battlegrounds; they are worth <strong>5,000 coins each</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can deploy with a <strong>free loadout</strong> and still leave with 15,000 to 20,000 coins. Old Battlegrounds is packed with Rocketeer Husks that pay out huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drone drivers are also needed to upgrade the gear bench and gunsmith, so loot as many as you can and check workbench requirements.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="lush-blooms">
      <h2>Lush Blooms</h2>
      <p>
        Lush Blooms matters because you need <strong>fruits</strong> to upgrade your property, especially <strong>Scrappy</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scrappy wants pears, olives, and plenty of them. Nearly every upgrade requires fruit, and upgrading Scrappy grants a ton of passive materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the <strong>Lush Blooms</strong> event:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fruit drop rates skyrocket</li>
        <li>Fruit baskets spawn around the map</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These baskets can drop more fruit than trees. Getting four or five olives from one basket is normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can literally run in with a free loadout and profit from the event.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="night-raids">
      <h2>Night Raids (Map Conditions)</h2>
      <p>
        Night raids are technically <strong>map conditions</strong>, but they function like events.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is the same map, except:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is nighttime</li>
        <li>Return points are limited</li>
        <li>No raider hatches</li>
        <li>Loot value is <strong>greatly increased</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many players double stack, turning in keys during night raids because of the loot boost.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is more dangerous:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>More Arc</li>
        <li>Stronger Arc</li>
        <li>Gear-heavy players hunting loot</li>
        <li>Fewer extracts funneling everyone into PvP</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Trials and Night Raids</h3>
      <p>
        Night raids are excellent for <strong>trials</strong> and <strong>three-star completions</strong>, which guarantee an epic drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you need Leaper damage, you will see more Leapers at night.</li>
        <li>Night raids grant <strong>2x progression</strong> for Arc-related objectives.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Open the map to track trial progress. During night raids, it rises faster, especially for Arc objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
        You must <strong>successfully extract</strong> for progress to count. Extract with a three-star clear to get the drops, including the guaranteed epic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trials reset weekly. Target them every week for guaranteed epics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="electromagnetic-storm">
      <h2>Electromagnetic Storm (Future Map Condition)</h2>
      <p>
        If you have seen a lightning icon on the map, that is the <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong> condition.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will not see it until <strong>November 8</strong>, but it appeared during the server slam.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the event:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Lightning strikes all over the map</li>
        <li>Blue circles appear before each strike</li>
        <li>Simply avoid standing in these circles</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It completely changes the battlefield. You are already dealing with players and Arc, and now lightning joins the party.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will have to wait for the benefits, but expect something similar to night raids with better loot.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="spaceport-bunker-roadmap">
      <h2>Spaceport Bunker and Upcoming Content</h2>
      <h3>Spaceport Bunker (Hidden Bunker Event)</h3>
      <p>
        During the Arc Raiders tech test, there was a <strong>Hidden Bunker</strong> event on Assera Spaceport. Players activated three antennas around the map to open the bunker and loot the interior.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have yet to see it post launch, but it could return soon.
      </p>

      <h3>Roadmap and New Map Conditions</h3>
      <p>
        Embark released a roadmap for the next few months. You may have noticed <strong>"new map conditions"</strong> in the ongoing updates with a lightning bolt symbol &mdash; likely referring to the Electromagnetic Storm.
      </p>
      <p>
        That has not stopped speculation. In the pre-order trailer, a raider finds the Queen and the sky is packed with drones. Maybe that variant shows up later.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <strong>November</strong>, we get a community unlock event. Most likely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>It is a one-time event</li>
        <li>Completion unlocks the fifth Arc Raiders map, <strong>Stella Montis</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In <strong>December</strong>, expect:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A new <strong>snowfall map condition</strong></li>
        <li>The <strong>Flickering Flames</strong> event</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We have seen a quick look at the snowfall condition, but nothing on Flickering Flames yet.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="secret-puzzles">
      <h2>Secret Puzzles (Blue Gate Map)</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike timed events and map conditions, <strong>secret puzzles</strong> can be tackled anytime under any condition. All known puzzles sit on the <strong>Blue Gate</strong> map and can award epic weapons.
      </p>

      <h3>Raiders Refuge</h3>
      <p>
        Raiders Refuge sits in a specific spot on the map. When you arrive, a trap door rests next to a rundown building.
      </p>
      <p>
        To open the bunker door:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hit <strong>four buttons</strong> scattered around the building</li>
        <li>Each button has a light, making it easier to spot</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Check every corner until you find all four. Once they are lit, the door opens and you can loot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: A <strong>Rocketeer</strong> and a <strong>Snitch</strong> often patrol, so clear them first.
      </p>

      <h3>Ancient Fort</h3>
      <p>
        The Ancient Fort has a similar bunker puzzle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Find three fuel cells inside the fort</li>
        <li>Follow the wires from the bunker to locate each receptacle</li>
        <li>Deposit all three fuel cells</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once all three are placed, the bunker door opens for looting.

      <h3>Deforester Husk</h3>
      <p>
        Unlike the other two, the <strong>Deforester Husk</strong> can be active or dead. It appears random.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>If you see sparks and a metal sheet across the opening, the puzzle is available.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You need <strong>two Arc power cells</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Loot nearby Arc (for example, a Wasper) for cells</li>
        <li>Bring cells into the raid</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Steps:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Insert one power cell near the entrance to activate flaming jets</li>
        <li>Walk past them to the second sparking receptacle and place the second cell</li>
        <li>Climb up the wreckage and walk back into the husk</li>
        <li>Interact with the floor to deactivate the flames</li>
        <li>Search the husk for loot</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is not as valuable as the other puzzles, but still worth doing if you are close.

      <h2>Key Rooms</h2>
      <p>
        Key rooms appear on every map and require the <strong>specific key</strong> for that room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keys drop from:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quests</li>
        <li>The <strong>Raider Deck</strong> (battle pass)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you get a key, inspect it to learn:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Which map it belongs to</li>
        <li>Which location it opens</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Take that key to the right map and door.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Rarities and Loot</h3>
      <p>
        Not all keys are equal. The <strong>rarity</strong> tells you how much loot to expect.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Uncommon keys</strong> &mdash; Above average loot; can still drop multiple epics</li>
        <li><strong>Epic keys</strong> &mdash; Should shower you with goodies (RNG still applies)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Loot is still RNG, so do not sleep on uncommon keys. They can absolutely spit out multiple epics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Graphics exist showing every key location on every map, and playlists like Niko Kamiko's videos can walk you through each room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Always place your key in the <strong>safe slot</strong> so you do not lose it on death.
      </p>

      <h3>POIs Without Keys</h3>
      <p>
        Even without a key, map POIs still offer valuable loot.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best is <strong>Plaza Rosa</strong> in Buried City:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Breach the door or sneak through a window</li>
        <li>Loot high value trinkets and weapon mods</li>
        <li>The extract sits just below</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Get in, get out, and walk away loaded.
      </p>

        That is the full breakdown. Arc Raiders keeps evolving, so expect even more additions to this list over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        These events constantly change how the game plays, and the map conditions keep Arc Raiders fresh every run.
