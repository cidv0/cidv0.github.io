Guide Title: Base Building & Power Systems Overview
Current Status: Missing.
Research Targets:
- Summarize the philosophy of repurposing facility rooms vs. constructing new structures.
- Provide baseline requirements for a functional base (bench, storage, bed, power routing).
- Explain nightly power shutdowns and their implications.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- What triggers enemy raids or increased patrols near player bases?
- How far can power extenders run, and do they have loss factors?
- Are there sector-specific perks or dangers for base placement?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- Community base showcase videos, official blogs, in-game terminal lore.
Output Notes:
- Include an early-game base starter kit and upgrade roadmap.
- Link heavily to sub-guides on location, power, and defense.
