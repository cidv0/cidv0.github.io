Guide Title: Power & Electricity
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Explain day/night power availability, grid shutdown timings, and breaker locations.
- Document power extenders, generators (if any), battery backups, and light sources.
- Note which devices require constant power vs. internal batteries.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- How far can extension chains reach without failure?
- Are there hazards (sparks, overloading) from misusing power?
- Can players reroute facility circuits or restore global power later?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game experimentation, dev commentary on power systems, community guides.
Output Notes:
- Include wiring diagrams and emergency lighting plans.
- Reference survival (night runs) and exploration (sector power puzzles).
