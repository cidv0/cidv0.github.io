Guide Title: Buffs & Debuffs
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Compile all status effects (temporary, persistent, environmental) with icons, triggers, durations, and mechanical impact.
- Note which buffs stem from traits, consumables, equipment, or environmental bonuses.
- Map countermeasures: items, rest, medical devices, or facilities that clear negative statuses.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Do multiple debuffs stack additively or multiplicatively?
- Are there hidden thresholds (e.g., fatigue levels that trigger additional penalties)?
- Which buffs are unique to co-op interactions (team auras, shared devices)?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game status UI, laboratory logs, or terminal entries that explain anomalies.
- Community findings on rare debuffs (radiation sickness, hallucinations, etc.).
- Official balance notes documenting changes to status durations.
Output Notes:
- Organize by category (Physiological, Environmental, Combat, Crafting) and add quick-reference tables.
- Include "Emergency Response" flow for curing overlapping conditions.
