Guide Title: Classes & Specializations
Current Status: Needs research dump and eventual HTML layout.
Research Targets:
- Catalog every starting job/specialization with attribute modifiers, starting equipment, innate perks, and drawbacks.
- Record trait point costs and synergies (e.g., Fanny Pack cost, traits that offset negatives).
- Identify unlock conditions for hidden or advanced jobs, if any.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Which roles pair best for solo vs. co-op teams?
- Are there specialization-exclusive crafting recipes or dialogue options?
- How do negative traits stack--are multiple penalties allowed, and do they compound?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game character creator screenshots for each job screen.
- Patch notes or balance posts describing recent buffs/nerfs to jobs.
- Community tier lists for context (cite cautiously and mark subjective opinions).
Output Notes:
- Build a comparison table by attribute and a quick recommendation matrix (solo / duo / full squad).
- Include examples of role synergy, linking out to the class synergy page once it exists.
