Guide Title: Character Creation & Progression Overview
Current Status: Not started (needs full HTML guide).
Research Targets:
- Outline the character creation flow: job selection, trait point spending, starting attributes, and default loadout.
- Document the core attributes (Strength, Fitness, Intellect, Creativity, Empathy, Luck) and how they influence derived skills or unlock interactions.
- Summarize progression beats: how experience is earned, how often level-ups occur, and what unlocks they provide (stat points, perks, ideas).
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Which creation choices are permanent vs. re-speccable later, and what costs are involved?
- Do specializations modify spawn location, starting recipes, or faction reputation?
- How does co-op hosting influence individual character progression?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- Official release notes and in-game tooltips for the most recent patch.
- Community spreadsheets or wiki tables that list job modifiers (cross-check for accuracy).
- Developer interviews or trailers that explain long-term progression systems.
Output Notes:
- Produce a two-section overview: "Creation Checklist" and "Long-Term Progression" with cross-links to sub-guides.
- Add a callout that points to recommended first-run builds without prescribing spoilers.
