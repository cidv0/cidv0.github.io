Guide Title: Skills & Experience
Current Status: Missing.
Research Targets:
- List the full skill tree, including how skills level (use-based vs. XP spend) and the numeric benefits per rank.
- Capture global level thresholds (if characters have level caps or milestone rewards).
- Document how XP splits in multiplayer--host vs. clients, proximity bonuses, or shared pools.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- What activities power-level each skill efficiently?
- Are there diminishing returns or soft caps to prevent over-specialization?
- How does death or respec affect accumulated skill XP?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game skill UI, tooltips, and experimentation results from community guides.
- Official developer posts about the XP formula.
- Patch history showing adjustments to leveling speed.
Output Notes:
- Provide a leveling flow chart (early, mid, late game goals) and sidebars for grind tips.
- Cross-reference relevant survival, combat, and crafting guides for examples.
