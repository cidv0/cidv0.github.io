Guide Title: Environmental Hazards
Current Status: Missing.
Research Targets:
- Catalogue hazards: radiation, toxins, temperature extremes, anomalies, fog, electrical discharges.
- Identify warning signs (UI alerts, sound cues) and safe thresholds.
- List mitigation tools (gear, consumables, base upgrades).
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Do hazards stack, and how quickly do they inflict damage or debuffs?
- Are some hazards tied to events (facility alarms, portal storms)?
- How do hazards behave in Anteverse biomes vs. main facility?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game readings (Geiger counter, thermometers), community data.
Output Notes:
- Create a response matrix: hazard, immediate action, long-term fix.
