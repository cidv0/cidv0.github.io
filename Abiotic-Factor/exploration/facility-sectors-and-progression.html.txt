Guide Title: Facility Sectors & Progression
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Map every major sector, access requirements (keycards, crafted tools), and notable resources.
- Document storyline-neutral progression steps (build radio, craft hazmat) needed to advance.
- Track optional side sectors worth visiting early for upgrades.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Are sectors instanced or seamless? Any loading quirks to note?
- Do sectors change after night events or portal incursions?
- How does co-op handle sector unlocks for late-joining players?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- Speedrun notes, community progression guides, official patch notes.
Output Notes:
- Provide a progression roadmap (Act 1, Act 2, etc.) without narrative spoilers.
