Guide Title: Armor & Gear
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- List protective sets (lab coats, hazmat suits, riot gear) with defense stats and resistances.
- Note unique set bonuses (carry weight, radiation shielding, temperature resistance).
- Track how armor interacts with encumbrance and mobility.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Can armor pieces be mixed, and do bonuses stack?
- How do you repair or upgrade gear (crafting materials, benches)?
- Are there environmental conditions that require specific gear (space suit analogs)?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game gear descriptions, community testing on resistances, official patch changes.
Output Notes:
- Build a slot-by-slot comparison table and quick recommendations per biome/sector.
- Link to environmental hazards and inventory guides.
