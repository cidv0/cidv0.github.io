Guide Title: Durability & Repair
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Chart durability loss rates for weapons, tools, and gear under different usage scenarios.
- List repair options (duct tape, spare parts, benches) and associated costs/time.
- Note any breakage penalties (item destruction, reduced max durability).
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Do higher crafting tiers increase base durability?
- Are there skills or traits that reduce wear or improve repair efficiency?
- How does co-op repair work--can one player repair another's gear?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game testing, community spreadsheets on durability numbers, developer comments.
Output Notes:
- Add a maintenance schedule chart and emergency repair kit checklist.
- Reference weapons/tools and armor guides for context.
