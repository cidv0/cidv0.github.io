Guide Title: Ideation & Crafting System
Current Status: Missing.
Research Targets:
- Explain the ideation mini-game: clue colors, slot types, failure penalties, and unlock flow.
- Compile examples of first-idea items and their required components.
- Determine whether ideas are player-specific or shared across clients.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Can ideas be lost or overwritten? Are there research terminals that grant them?
- What happens when you guess ingredients wrong multiple times?
- Are there passive bonuses that increase ideation success chance?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game crafting UI, developer blogs, community tutorials.
- Patch notes on ideation tweaks.
Output Notes:
- Include annotated screenshots (once captured) and a quick reference for color coding.
- Link to stations guide for where each recipe is crafted.
