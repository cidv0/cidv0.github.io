Guide Title: Resource Gathering & Salvaging
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Catalog salvageable objects by facility zone and the materials they yield.
- Quantify drop rates or average outputs for key scrap types (metal, fabric, tech components).
- Identify early-game vs. late-game resource bottlenecks and solutions.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Which tools speed up dismantling, and what durability costs apply?
- How do stealth or noise impact salvaging runs (attracting enemies)?
- Can teammates tag or reserve objects for salvage in co-op?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- Player-made maps, loot tables, and developer commentary.
- In-game experimentation to confirm salvage outputs.
Output Notes:
- Provide sector-based farming routes and a checklist of must-grab items.
- Add link-outs to crafting recipes that rely on rare components.
