Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Can multiple players revive simultaneously, and are there cooldowns?
- What happens if all players wipe--does the world reset or persist?
- Are there co-op exclusive revival perks or tech?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game testing, community death run reports, developer clarifications.
Output Notes:
