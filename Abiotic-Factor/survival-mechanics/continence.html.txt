Guide Title: Continence & Bathroom Needs
Current Status: Missing.
Research Targets:
- Document the continence meter timing, mini-game mechanics, and failure penalties.
- Identify all toilet options: facility bathrooms, portable toilets, craftable substitutes.
- Clarify the utility of byproducts (Bag of Feces uses in crafting or farming).
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Can continence be reset via consumables or resting?
- Do teammates trigger shared bathroom events or leave messes that cause debuffs?
- Are there sanitation upgrades for bases?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game prompts, UI indications, and crafting menus.
- Community discussions on creative continence solutions.
- Patch notes in case mechanics were toned down or expanded.
Output Notes:
- Include a humorous but informative tone, with a mini flowchart for emergency bathroom planning.
