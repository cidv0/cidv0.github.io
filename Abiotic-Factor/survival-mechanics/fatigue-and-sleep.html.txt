Guide Title: Fatigue & Sleep
Current Status: Empty.
Research Targets:
- Record how fatigue accumulates (time awake, sprinting, crafting) and quantify penalties per stage.
- Detail sleeping options: couches, crafted beds, portable shelters, and their respawn behavior.
- Investigate whether beds provide bonuses (XP boosts, protection) or multi-player sleeping rules.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- Does time skip during sleep or do enemies keep moving?
- Can players sleep in shifts in multiplayer, and how does that influence power cycles?
- Are there consumables that reduce fatigue or extend wakefulness?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game HUD cues, sleep prompts, and base building recipes.
- Community testing on sleep efficiency and safe zones.
- Developer Q&A about night events and sleep safety.
Output Notes:
- Offer a "Safe Sleep Checklist" and map recommended base locations for resting early game.
