Guide Title: Health & Injury
Current Status: Needs research.
Research Targets:
- Break down damage sources (melee, ranged, environmental, status) and scaling with difficulty.
- List healing options: consumables, medical devices, resting, base facilities, skill perks.
- Detail injury states (bleeding, fractures, infections) and treatment requirements.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- How much health is lost on death and what is the penalty for failing to treat injuries?
- Can injuries stack, and do they gate actions (e.g., slow movement, reduced carry weight)?
- Are there co-op revive mechanics tied to medical skills?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game medical crafting recipes and effect descriptions.
- Community guides on combat healing rotations.
- Developer posts about injury tuning.
Output Notes:
- Provide a triage priority list and a quick reference table for med supplies.
- Reference synergy with Combat and Item Mechanics (medicine crafting).
