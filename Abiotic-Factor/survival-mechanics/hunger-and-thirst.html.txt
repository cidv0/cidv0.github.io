Guide Title: Hunger & Thirst
Current Status: Research + first draft required.
Research Targets:
- List available food and drink categories (raw, cooked, vending machine, crafted) with hunger/thirst values and side effects.
- Document spoilage rules, storage solutions, and synergy with cooking stations.
- Map out water sources (sinks, coolers, natural pools) noting purity levels and refill mechanics.
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- What happens at critical starvation/dehydration thresholds?
- How do dietary buffs (caffeine, sugar rush) interact with other stats?
- Can players share containers or set up automated refills?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game item descriptions and stat blocks.
- Community experiments on cooking recipes and combo meals.
- Patch notes adjusting food values or vending machine costs.
Output Notes:
- Build a "First Week Meal Plan" table plus advanced tips for infinite water loops.
- Highlight synergy with Sustained Resources guide and base power outages.
