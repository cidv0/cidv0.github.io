Guide Title: Survival Mechanics Overview
Current Status: Not started.
Research Targets:
- Provide a synopsis of each survival meter (hunger, thirst, fatigue, continence, health) and describe failure states.
- Identify the cadence at which needs drain in real-time and how difficulty modifiers adjust rates.
- Gather best practices for balancing daily routines (loot runs vs. rest vs. crafting).
Gameplay Questions to Answer:
- What penalties kick in at each threshold (UI color changes, speed debuffs, HP decay)?
- How does co-op sharing of resources influence survival pacing?
- Are there base upgrades or research that slow depletion?
Data & Sources to Collect:
- In-game handbook/tooltips, verified with testing for timers.
- Community spreadsheets timing need depletion per action.
- Developer posts about survival balance knobs.
Output Notes:
- Present a daily planner timeline and link to individual need guides.
- Keep spoilers out; focus on mechanics and planning heuristics.
